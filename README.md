# ARCHAI (Autonomous Research for Computer Hardware using AI)
ARCHAI is an autonomous pre-silicon co-design platform that uses Gemini 3 to explore, evaluate, and optimize microarchitectural configurations using gem5 simulations and targeted RTL implementations. It iteratively runs performance experiments, analyzes cache and pipeline tradeoffs (IPC, CPI, miss rates), and proposes new designs using long-horizon reasoning rather than single-prompt generation. ARCHAI bridges high-level architecture exploration and SystemVerilog-level verification, enabling data-driven hardware design decisions before committing to silicon.
